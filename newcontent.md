# Hi I'm Kenny Brijs

## A Front-End Webdeveloper with a love for Usability

Currently working for [Thanksys] in Hasselt and looking for a cool company in Ghent in order to move closer to my hometown Aalst.

I worked at the [VikingCo] offices for almost 3 years now and had great fun there.

Most of my time there was spent on what started out as a research project, now called [CityLife]
