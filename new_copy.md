## Front-End Webdeveloper

### Hi! I’m Kenny,

a front-end webdeveloper from Aalst (Belgium) with a love for users and a knack for [KISSing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle "Keep It Simple, Stupid").

For two years I’ve been building, maintaining and extending websites for [VikingCo](https://vikingco.com) in Hasselt: the founders of [Mobile Vikings](https://mobilevikings.be/en/) and [CityLife](https://citylife.be/#!/nl/).

### I’d like to move it, move it!
Longing to move closer to my hometown **I’m looking for a cool web-company in Ghent**, where I’d love to expand my skillset from **implementing websites**—with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and their frameworks and preprocessors—to **creating them**: storytelling, copywriting, wireframing, [IA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture), [UI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface_design) and [UX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design).

After reading [The Design of Everyday Things](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things), all these fancy buzzwords seem to point to one principle: How can I make this website as simple as possible for any stupid user like myself?
